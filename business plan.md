1) What Nordix AI is

A restaurant commerce + discovery platform built around one core asset:

Structured menu data + AI conversation
→ turns “static menu pages” into conversion funnels (for restaurants) and deep search (for consumers).

You’re building two products on the same data layer:

B2B: AI Menu + Ordering Widget (revenue now)

B2C: Discovery Chat App (distribution + future revenue)

2) B2B Business Model (Restaurants)
Core customer

Independent restaurants (single or multi-branch), especially:

tourist traffic

ethnic cuisines (more questions, language barrier)

dietary complexity (halal, vegan, allergies, satvik, etc.)

B2B value proposition (what they pay for)

A. More orders

AI improves menu understanding → higher conversion

“Order without scrolling” experience

B. Keep margin

drive orders direct, reduce dependence on marketplaces

C. Reduce staff load

fewer calls/messages about menu items, allergens, ingredients

D. Better menu presentation

structured tags, modifiers, add-ons, upsell bundles

B2B products (what you sell)

1) Hosted menu page + embed widget

“menu on Nordix” and/or “embed on their website”

multilingual AI chat + structured menu

2) Online ordering

MVP: pay at restaurant

Next: Stripe pay now + platform fee

3) Analytics

proof of value: views → chats → carts → orders → CTA clicks

language distribution proves tourist usage

Pricing (simple first)

You want pricing that matches restaurant thinking:

Plan A — Starter (for early adoption)

299–399 SEK/month

AI menu + chat + basic analytics

ordering “pay at restaurant” included

Plan B — Pro (your target 699 SEK/month)

699 SEK/month

AI menu + chat + analytics + ordering + upsells + priority support

includes usage cap (messages/month)

Transaction revenue (when Stripe on)

platform fee per order: e.g. 1–3% or 2–5 SEK per order

keep it lower than delivery platforms, so it’s an easy “yes”

Why restaurants will pay (even if they have WooCommerce/POS)

You don’t replace immediately. You attach value:

Keep their existing “Order” flow initially if needed

Add your AI + structured menu + “Add to cart”

Then move checkout into Nordix once trust is built

The real sell is: better conversion + better UX + control, not “AI is cool”.

B2B unit economics (shape, not exact numbers)

Costs per restaurant:

OpenAI usage (messages + embeddings)

hosting + DB

support time

Revenue per restaurant:

subscription (MRR)

later: platform fees on orders

Goal:

subscription covers fixed costs

platform fee scales with success (good alignment)

3) B2C Business Model (Consumers / Tourists)
B2C value proposition

“Perplexity for restaurants.”
People don’t want filters and search bars. They want:

“Halal butter chicken near me”

“Satvik food in Lauterbrunnen”

“Gluten-free, nut-free desserts”

“Spicy vegetarian under 150 SEK”

Your discovery chat does:

understands intent + constraints

searches structured menu database

returns restaurants + exact matching dishes

How B2C helps B2B (the flywheel)

This is the engine:

More restaurants onboard → more menus + better coverage

Better coverage → B2C becomes useful

B2C traffic → restaurants see value

Restaurants upgrade to paid / pay for placement

More revenue → you improve product → repeats

B2C monetization options (phase-based)

Phase 1 (now): no monetization, use B2C as acquisition + proof

it helps you collect data and show investors “real usage”

Phase 2 (once there’s traffic):

Sponsored placements / promoted dishes

restaurants pay monthly for boosted visibility

Premium listing

more photos, highlights, “top match” badge, featured menu

Lead generation

“get directions / call / reserve” conversions as measurable value

Transaction fee

when ordering via discovery, small fee per order

4) Positioning vs competitors (why you’re different)
Why Yelp/Google/TripAdvisor fail

They search businesses, not menu semantics.
They don’t understand:

hidden ingredients

dietary constraints

dish-level matching

multilingual query intent

Why Foodora/Wolt aren’t your direct replacement

They are a delivery marketplace with commission.
You are:

direct-to-consumer ordering layer

with discovery as a second channel

Your moat (what gets stronger over time)

structured menu dataset (tags, modifiers, allergens, religious tags)

query logs → better ranking + better UX

restaurant retention grows as their menu + data + analytics is built on you

5) What to track (investor + sales proof)

You need metrics that scream “value”:

B2B metrics

views → chats → add-to-cart → orders (funnel)

CTA clicks (call/directions/order)

language breakdown (tourist proof)

repeat usage per restaurant (stickiness)

conversion uplift vs old menu (even anecdotal first)

B2C metrics

searches/day, sessions/day

searches that result in a “match”

CTR to restaurant menu pages

actions: directions/call/order click

retention: weekly returning users

6) Go-to-market
Step 1: Get first 10 restaurants (Gothenburg)

Pitch:

“AI menu + ordering, multilingual, designed for tourists & dietary needs”

“Cheaper than marketplace commissions”

“Works on your site, you own customers”

Step 2: Seed B2C with “demo restaurants”

You can create 20 demo restaurants, but the key is:

make them realistic

make them searchable

use this as a product demo and a consumer test environment

Step 3: Expand to tourist hubs (Switzerland, etc.)

Tourist cities are perfect because:

language barrier is extreme

dining decisions are high intent

tourists search a lot

7) Revenue streams summary (simple investor slide)

B2B:

Subscription (299–699 SEK/mo)

Add-ons (extra languages, extra messages, extra locations)

Transaction fee (later, Stripe)

B2C:

Sponsored results

Premium listings

Transaction fee on orders from discovery

Partnerships (tourism, hotels, city guides) later

8) Your smartest near-term model (what I’d run)

Yes: B2B ordering (pay at restaurant now) + Stripe later
Yes: Discovery chat as a demo + data collection tool
No: heavy “consumer growth marketing” until you have enough restaurants

You’re building the right direction — just keep it stepwise:

B2B = revenue + data

B2C = distribution + investor story
